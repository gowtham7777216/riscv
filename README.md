RISC-V Workshop
This repository contains notes, resources, and code examples from the 2-day RISC-V workshop I attended. The workshop provided an in-depth introduction to RISC-V architecture, its ecosystem, and practical applications. Below are detailed descriptions of the topics covered each day.

Workshop Overview
Duration: 2 Days
Focus: Introduction to RISC-V architecture and hands-on experience with its software tools, assembly language, and optimization techniques.

Day 1: Introduction to RISC-V Concepts and Software Tools
On Day 1, we were introduced to the core concepts of the RISC-V architecture and the surrounding software ecosystem. Topics covered included:

Introduction to RISC-V Architecture:

The open-source nature of RISC-V and how it differs from proprietary architectures.
The modularity of RISC-V, allowing customization of hardware and software.
Understanding the instruction set architecture (ISA) of RISC-V, including its base instructions and optional extensions.
Software Tools Overview:

Overview of key tools for RISC-V development, including simulators, compilers, and debuggers.
Introduction to RISC-V compilers like GCC for RISC-V and simulators like Spike for software testing.
Setting up a development environment for RISC-V and configuring necessary software tools.
Hands-on Exercises:

Setting up and compiling basic programs for RISC-V.
Running simple RISC-V code on simulators to observe instruction-level execution.
Day 2: In-Depth Learning and Practical Applications
Day 2 delved deeper into the technical aspects of RISC-V, focusing on advanced topics and providing a hands-on approach to more complex concepts. The key topics included:

RISC-V Assembly Language:

Detailed exploration of RISC-V assembly language and instruction formats.
Writing and debugging assembly programs for RISC-V.
Understanding how to perform arithmetic, logic, and control operations in assembly.
Performance Optimization:

Techniques for optimizing RISC-V programs, focusing on instruction-level performance improvements.
Using profiling tools to analyze and improve the performance of RISC-V applications.
Best practices for writing efficient RISC-V code and avoiding common pitfalls.
Hands-on Projects:
